# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** October 22, 2025
**Facilitator:** Mary (Business Analyst)
**Participant:** User

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** A platform for Bangladeshi businesses (primarily on Facebook/WhatsApp) to easily create a product showcase website (on a subdomain) with an integrated AI chatbot (Messenger) linked to the website's product database.

**Session Goals:** To define a focused prototype for an idea competition. The prototype must demonstrate simple, working functionality for two core components: 1) a simple website builder and 2) a Messenger text responder linked to the website data.

**Techniques Used:** First Principles Thinking, "What If" Scenarios

**Key Themes Identified:**
* **Simplicity for Owner:** The website builder must be extremely easy to use for non-technical business owners.
* **Core Prototype Focus:** The MVP for the competition will *only* include the website builder and the Messenger chatbot.
* **Chatbot as Information Funnel:** The chatbot's primary role is to provide information and navigate users to the website; it will *not* handle transactions.
* **Graceful Failure:** The chatbot must intelligently handle queries it cannot fully answer (e.g., product attributes like color) by providing the best available information and directing users to the website.

## Technique Sessions

### First Principles Thinking - (for Website Builder)

**Description:** This technique was used to break down the "simple website builder" into its absolute, fundamental components to define the prototype.

**Ideas Generated:**
* The core principle of the builder is **simplicity and friendliness** for non-technical owners.
* The fundamental "product" entity (must-haves for the prototype) consists of: **Title**, **Price**, and **Image**.
* Optional product fields (to be added later) include: Description.
* The core action for the owner is a single **"Add New Product" button**.
* This button will open a simple form with exactly three fields:
    1.  Product Title (text box)
    2.  Product Price (text box)
    3.  Product Image (upload button)
* The owner will just hit a **"Save" button** to list the product.
* The customer-facing website (on the subdomain) will display products in a **grid layout** (similar to Amazon).
* The website must have a **search bar** at the top.
* For the prototype, this search bar will only filter the grid by matching text against the **Product Title**.

**Insights Discovered:**
* The website builder prototype is clearly defined by a 3-field product entity and a title-searchable grid view. This meets the goal of a "simple working functionality explainable version."

**Notable Connections:**
* The 3-field product entity (Title, Price, Image) directly defines the simple database that the *other* half of the prototype—the Messenger chatbot—will use for its intelligent responses.

### "What If" Scenarios - (for Messenger Chatbot)

**Description:** This technique was used to explore the chatbot's logic, boundaries, and responses based on the limited data from the simple website builder.

**Ideas Generated:**
* **Scenario 1:** Customer asks for a product attribute *not* in the database (e.g., "Do you have red shirts?").
    * **Response:** The chatbot will use the "Honest" AI approach (Option 1). It will parse the query, identify the *intent* ("shirt"), and search the **Titles** for it. It will then reply with the matching products (e.g., "Casual T-Shirt") and state that it cannot see colors, helpfully providing a *link* to the website's search results for "shirt."
* **Scenario 2:** Customer expresses purchase intent via chat (e.g., "Okay, I want to buy the 'Casual T-Shirt'").
    * **Response:** The chatbot will *not* handle transactions (Option 2). It will reply by funneling the user to the website: "To place an order, please visit our website: [link to specific product page]."
* **Scenario 3:** Customer asks a direct, answerable question (e.g., "What's the price of the 'Casual T-Shirt'?").
    * **Response:** The chatbot will provide a "Full Showcase" response (Option 3). This is the best demonstration of the integrated system and includes:
        1.  **Text Answer:** "The 'Casual T-Shirt' is [Price]."
        2.  **Product Image:** [Sends the product's image in the chat].
        3.  **Funnel Link:** "See more details or place an order here: [Link to specific product page]."

**Insights Discovered:**
* The chatbot's "intelligence" for the prototype is defined as information retrieval and navigation, not transaction processing.
* The chatbot's primary function is to act as an intelligent funnel *to* the website, reinforcing the connection between the two systems.
* The "Full Showcase" response is the ideal reply as it uses all three data fields (Title, Price, Image) from the website builder.

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities (Prototype Features)
* **Website Builder:** A single "Add New Product" button that opens a simple 3-field form (Title, Price, Image) and saves to a database.
* **Website Showcase:** A public subdomain page that displays all products from the database in a grid layout.
* **Website Search:** A search bar on the showcase page that filters the product grid based on matching the **Product Title** only.
* **Chatbot - Query Handling:** An "Honest" AI search that parses user intent vs. attributes and links to the web search for partial matches.
* **Chatbot - Info Retrieval:** A "Full Showcase" response (Text, Image, Link) for direct, answerable questions (e.g., price).
* **Chatbot - Funneling:** A dedicated response that directs all purchase intents to the specific product page on the website.

### Future Innovations (Post-Prototype)
* WhatsApp integration.
* Chatbot transaction handling (e.g., in-chat ordering, address collection).
* Smarter chatbot search (searching descriptions, using NLP for attributes).
* More complex website builder (e.g., product descriptions, categories, drag-and-drop page layout).
* Payment gateway integration on the website.

### Insights & Learnings
* The core value proposition for the prototype is the *link* between the simple website (data source) and the intelligent chatbot (information funnel).
* Focusing on "graceful failure" (like the "red shirt" scenario) actually makes the prototype look *smarter* than a bot that simply says "product not found."

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas
1.  **Priority #1: Website Builder & Database**
    * **Rationale:** This is the foundational data source for the entire system. Without it, the chatbot has no data.
    * **Next steps:** Build the simple "Add New Product" form (Title, Price, Image) and the database schema to store this information.
2.  **Priority #2: Website Showcase & Search**
    * **Rationale:** This is the customer-facing web component and the destination for the chatbot's funnel.
    * **Next steps:** Build the public-facing page that fetches products, displays them in a grid, and implements the title-only search bar.
3.  **Priority #3: Chatbot Integration & Logic**
    * **Rationale:** This is the "intelligent" component and the key differentiator for the competition.
    * **Next steps:** Build the Messenger bot, connect it to the product database, and implement the three core response scenarios defined in our "What If" session (partial match, purchase intent, and direct question).

## Reflection & Follow-up

**What Worked Well:**
* Using First Principles quickly defined the *minimum* set of features for the website builder (Title, Price, Image).
* Using "What If" Scenarios clearly defined the chatbot's logic and, most importantly, its *boundaries* (no transactions).

**Areas for Further Exploration:**
* What is the simplest way to handle the "subdomain" creation for a new business owner?
* How will the owner link their *specific* Facebook page to their *specific* website database? (Authentication/linking mechanism).

**Recommended Follow-up Techniques:**
* Use **"First Principles Thinking"** again to define the *minimum* process for an owner to sign up and link their Facebook page.
