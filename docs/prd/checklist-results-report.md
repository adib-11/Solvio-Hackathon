| 3. User Experience Requirements  | PASS      | Minor assumptions (e.g., Product Detail Page) need final confirmation but are reasonable for a prototype. |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PASS      | None                                                                                                        |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PASS      | None                                                                                                        |

| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | N/A       | Minimal data/integration requirements for this prototype.                                                     |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS      | Document is well-structured based on brief.                                                                 |

## Top Issues by Priority
* **BLOCKERS:** None.
* **HIGH:** None.
* **MEDIUM:**
    * Need to finalize the exact flow for owner signup and subdomain creation (Stories 1.2, 1.3). The current stories are logical but details will need architect input.
* **LOW:**
    * Consider adding an "Edit Product" story to Epic 1 for owner convenience, though not strictly required by the brief.

## MVP Scope Assessment
* The scope aligns perfectly with the competition prototype goals defined in the brief.
* Features are minimal but viable.
* No scope creep identified.
* Complexity seems appropriate for a prototype.

## Technical Readiness
* Technical assumptions are clear and provide good constraints for the Architect.
* The chosen stack (React/Node/Serverless) is well-suited for the prototype.
* No major technical risks identified at this stage.

## Recommendations
* Proceed to the Architecture phase.
* During Architecture, pay close attention to the implementation details for Story 1.3 (Subdomain Provisioning) and Story 2.1 (Owner Chatbot Integration) as these involve external systems/complexity.
* Discuss adding an "Edit Product" feature with the user/stakeholder after the prototype.
