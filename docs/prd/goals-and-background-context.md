# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
* Build a foundational database and a simple website builder (3-field form: Title, Price, Image) for non-technical business owners.
* Create a customer-facing website (on a subdomain) with a grid layout and a title-only search bar.
* Implement an intelligent Messenger chatbot that is the key differentiator for the competition.
* The chatbot must act as an information funnel, directing all purchase intents to the website and *not* handling transactions.
* The chatbot must intelligently answer direct questions (e.g., price) with a "Full Showcase" response (Text, Image, Link).

## Background Context
This PRD defines a prototype for an idea competition. The target users are small to large Bangladeshi businesses that primarily operate on Facebook and WhatsApp without a dedicated product webpage.

The core problem is that these businesses handle customer queries inefficiently via manual messaging, leading to poor response times. The core value proposition is the direct link between a simple-to-use website (the data source) and an intelligent AI chatbot (the information funnel), which provides a better customer experience.

The prototype's scope is strictly limited to the website builder and the Messenger chatbot to demonstrate this core link. Key principles are simplicity for the owner and graceful failure (e.g., handling unanswerable queries) for the chatbot.
