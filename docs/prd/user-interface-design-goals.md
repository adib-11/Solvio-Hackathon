# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The core UX vision is **Simplicity and Friendliness**. The interface must be intuitive for a non-technical business owner to manage their products. For the end-customer, the showcase must be clean, familiar, and easy to navigate.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
1.  **Owner (Admin):** The primary interaction is a simple "Add New Product" flow: a button opens a modal or a new page with exactly three fields and a "Save" button.
2.  **Customer (Public):** The primary interactions are 1) browsing products in a grid and 2) using a search bar to filter that grid by product title.

## Core Screens and Views
* **Admin View (Owner):** A minimal "Product Dashboard" that shows a list of existing products and the "Add New Product" button.
* **Public View (Customer):** The "Product Showcase" page (on the subdomain) that displays the product grid and the search bar.
* **Public View (Customer):** A "Product Detail Page" (Assumption: clicking a product in the grid will lead here, as implied by chatbot link).

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
(Assumption: We will aim for WCAG AA compliance, a standard for web accessibility. This was not in the brief but is a best practice.)

## Branding
(Assumption: Branding will be minimal for the prototype. The platform will provide a clean, neutral template, and the business's own product images will provide the visual identity.)

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
(Assumption: Given the target market uses Facebook/WhatsApp, a mobile-first, web-responsive design is required. The showcase must look good on both mobile phones and desktops.)
