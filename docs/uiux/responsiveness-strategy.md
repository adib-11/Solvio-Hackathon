# Responsiveness Strategy

## Breakpoints

(Assumption: We'll use standard device breakpoints. Exact pixel values can be adjusted based on the chosen component library or CSS framework).
| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices        |
| :--------- | :-------- | :-------- | :-------------------- |
| Mobile     | 0px       | \~767px    | Smartphones           |
| Tablet     | \~768px    | \~1023px   | Tablets               |
| Desktop    | \~1024px   | \~1439px   | Laptops, Desktops     |
| Wide       | \~1440px   | -         | Large Desktop Monitors|

## Adaptation Patterns

  * **Layout Changes:**
      * The **Product Grid** will adjust the number of columns (e.g., 2 on mobile, 3 on tablet, 4+ on desktop).
      * The **Admin Dashboard** might stack elements vertically on mobile.
  * **Navigation Changes:** Minimal navigation is planned, so changes will be minor (likely none needed for the prototype).
  * **Content Priority:** Ensure key elements like the **Search Bar** and **Add New Product** button are easily accessible on mobile. Product image, title, and price must remain visible.
  * **Interaction Changes:** Touch target sizes will be considered for mobile usability.
