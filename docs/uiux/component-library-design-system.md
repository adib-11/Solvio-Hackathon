# Component Library / Design System

**Design System Approach:** (Assumption: Given the prototype nature and focus on speed, we will leverage a pre-built component library compatible with the chosen framework (React/Next.js). Using a library like Material UI, Chakra UI, or even simple Tailwind UI components will accelerate development and ensure consistency without needing to build basic elements like buttons or forms from scratch).

## Core Components

### Product Card

  * **Purpose:** To display a single product (Image, Title, Price) within the Product Showcase grid.
  * **Variants:** Standard display card.
  * **States:** Default state. (Hover effects could be added if time permits).
  * **Usage Guidelines:** Used within the responsive grid on the main showcase page. Clicking the card should navigate to the Product Detail Page.
