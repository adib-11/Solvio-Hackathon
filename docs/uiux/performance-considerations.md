# Performance Considerations

## Performance Goals

*(Assumption: Set achievable goals for a prototype).*

  * **Page Load:** Aim for First Contentful Paint (FCP) under 2 seconds on a simulated average mobile connection.
  * **Interaction Response:** Search filtering and form submissions should feel near-instant (\<500ms).
  * **Animation FPS:** Animations should maintain a smooth frame rate (aiming for 60 FPS).

## Design Strategies

*(Assumption: Define basic strategies).*

  * **Image Optimization:** Owner-uploaded images should be reasonably compressed and potentially served in modern formats (like WebP) if feasible for the prototype. Lazy loading images below the fold should be considered.
  * **Code Splitting:** Leverage framework features (like Next.js) for automatic code splitting per page.
  * **Minimize Heavy Libraries:** Be mindful of adding large dependencies that could slow down load times.
