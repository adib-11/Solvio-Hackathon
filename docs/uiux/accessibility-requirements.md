# Accessibility Requirements

## Compliance Target

  * **Standard:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA

## Key Requirements

  * **Visual:**
      * Color contrast ratios: Must meet WCAG AA requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
      * Focus indicators: All interactive elements must have a clear visual focus indicator.
      * Text sizing: Users should be able to resize text up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.
  * **Interaction:**
      * Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements must be reachable and operable via keyboard alone.
      * Screen reader support: Use semantic HTML to ensure compatibility with screen readers.
      * Touch targets: Ensure adequate size and spacing for touch targets on mobile devices.
  * **Content:**
      * Alternative text: All informative images (like product images) must have appropriate alt text. (Owner-provided images might be a challenge).
      * Heading structure: Use proper heading levels (H1, H2, H3...) for page structure.
      * Form labels: All form fields must have clear, programmatically associated labels.

## Testing Strategy

  * **(Assumption:** Basic automated checks (e.g., using browser extensions like Axe) and manual keyboard navigation testing will be performed during development).
  * **Testing:** Automated checks + Manual keyboard testing.
