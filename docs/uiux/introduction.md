## Overall UX Goals & Principles

* **Target User Personas:**
    * **Business Owner:** Non-technical individuals in Bangladesh running small to large businesses primarily via Facebook/WhatsApp. Needs extreme simplicity in managing products.
    * **End Customer:** Users browsing the owner's products on the web or interacting via Messenger. Needs a clean, familiar, easy-to-navigate showcase.
* **Usability Goals:**
    * **Ease of learning (Owner):** The owner should be able to list their first product within minutes without instructions.
    * **Efficiency of use (Owner):** Adding new products should be quick and require minimal steps.
    * **Clarity (Customer):** Product information (Image, Title, Price) must be clearly displayed.
    * **Findability (Customer):** Customers should be able to easily find products via browsing the grid or using the title search.
* **Design Principles:**
    1.  **Simplicity First:** Prioritize ease of use over complex features, especially for the owner.
    2.  **Clarity:** Ensure information is presented clearly and unambiguously.
    3.  **Familiarity:** Use common e-commerce patterns (like the grid layout) so customers feel comfortable.
    4.  **Responsiveness:** The design must work well on mobile devices.
    5.  **Accessibility:** Aim for WCAG AA compliance.
