# Animation & Micro-interactions

## Motion Principles

  * **(Assumption:** Animations should be subtle, quick, and meaningful, providing feedback without being distracting. Focus on standard transitions like fades or slides).

## Key Animations

  * **(Assumption:** Define minimal animations for core interactions).
      * **Button Feedback:** Subtle press/hover states on buttons like 'Add New Product' and 'Save'.
      * **Search Filter:** A smooth transition (e.g., fade in/out) as the product grid updates during search.
      * **Form Validation:** Clear visual cues (e.g., color change) for input validation errors on the 'Add Product' form.
