# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the AI Chat-Web Platform Prototype, including backend systems (serverless functions), frontend implementation (React/Next.js website), and their integration, specifically including the Facebook Messenger chatbot. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This unified approach combines backend and frontend architecture concerns, streamlining development for this modern fullstack application.

## Starter Template or Existing Project
* The PRD specifies using React (specifically Next.js) for the frontend and Node.js for the serverless backend, within a monorepo structure.
* Assumption: We will use `create-next-app` as a base within the monorepo, as no specific alternative starter was provided.
