# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

  * **Overall architecture readiness:** High.
  * **Critical risks identified:** Low (Facebook API, Subdomain handling).
  * **Key strengths:** Clear PRD alignment, pragmatic stack, leverages platform.
  * **Project type:** Full-stack. All sections evaluated.

## Section Analysis (Summary)

  * All sections PASSED validation for prototype scope.

## Risk Assessment

  * **1. Facebook API Integration (Medium):** Setup/Permissions complexity. Mitigation: Allocate time; simulate initially.
  * **2. Dynamic Subdomain Handling (Medium):** Vercel config complexity. Mitigation: Research early; have fallback (URL path).
  * **3. Image Optimization (Low):** Large owner uploads. Mitigation: Use Next.js `<Image>`; consider upload warnings.

## Recommendations

  * Finalize UI Library, State Management, File Storage choices during setup (Story 1.1).
  * Consider basic API integration tests if time allows.

## AI Implementation Readiness

  * Suitable due to clear structure, patterns, types, and standards.
